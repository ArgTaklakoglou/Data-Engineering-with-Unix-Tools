# Data-Engineering-with-Unix-Tools

The aim of this assignment is to analyze the data in order to help the 
bus company improve its operations, and thus improve everyday life in the city. 
In order to answer the questions I uses Unix command-line filter tools, such as grep, 
fgrep, wc, sort, cut, tee, xargs, uniq, awk, sed, join, comm, diff, seq, head, tail, rev, 
tac, gzip, tr, tsort, etc. 

The data contains constantly updated stream of GPS location records associated with public buses in Athens. The 
data (more than 560MB when uncompressed) are provided in a compressed format 
compatible with the gzip program. The stream's fields are: data acquisition time 
stamp, line number, bus number, position reporting time stamp, bus position latitude, 
bus position longitude.
